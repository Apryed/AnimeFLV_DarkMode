## **Description**
**Dark Mode** : Self explainatory. You can even change the colors yourself. You just have to edit the first line of colors, variable names are the color names, so it self explainatory too. Color definition MUST be HEX, since I use Alpha in a few places ( This Shouldn't affect your result, but if it does, search for said color variable, and you will find something like this `--c-lgrey00:'+lgrey+'00`. This is color Light Grey, with an alpha value of `00` - Which is fully transparent Light Grey.

**No Comment Section** : It just removes the comment section when viewing something. - Avoids Spoilers.

**No Distractions** : This adds functionality to the previous Script, by also removing the right pannel were TikTok, News and Discord are. It also resizes the main content.

### Note
Will try to create an extension for everything when I have the time.
